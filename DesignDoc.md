## Serpents in Space

After their previous bout against Manuel El Jackson, the serpents are seeking revenge. Manuel
went on a rampage and nearly killed off the entire snake population. Of the few surviving snakes,
two brilliant anacondas happened to be groundbreaking scientists in genetic mutation. After a
many years of research, the snakes created a new species of space serpents (Proof from NASA:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we2RQ3Ps82I). These snakes have the ability to fly through
outer space while carrying rocket launchers. Knowing that the Manuel and his fleet are heading
to Mars to pick up Martian war criminals, the snakes have planned retribution. Equipped with
weapons, the anacondas plan on taking down all of Manuel’s space vehicles.

The player’s main objective is to shoot down a never ending amount of Manuel’s spacecrafts
while trying to running into planets and the other objects in the game. The player is playing from
one of the snake’s perspective in the Anaconda Army. The challenge of the game is that
Manuel’s fleet will continue to grow in size. Another challenge of the game is that the agent does
not control the speed at which the snake moves. He or she can only change the direction that the
snake is facing. As time continues, the snake moves faster making it more challenging to hit
targets and avoid obstacles. The overall goal of the game is to get a high score because the game
is never ending.

The agent has two actions. The first being where the snake is facing. The screen is the first
person representation of a snake. Using the mouse, the agent can change the direction the camera
is facing and therefore the movement of the snake. The second control is fire. This is used to
launch missiles at Manuel’s space fleet. Space bar will be used to physically control the
launching of the missiles and the missiles will travel in the direction that the snake is pointing at
fire time.

There are a few dynamics of the game that change over time. The first being that the snake will
move faster as time continues (the scientists for some reason could not fix this problem). There
will also be more objects in the field of play as time continues. These events make it harder to
avoid objects and hit targets.

There are two strategies for the game. One strategy is to primarily focus on avoiding the objects.
The objects in the sky do not attack the user but do damage in the result of a collision. This could
lead to a high score because the agent gets points for the amount of time alive in the game.
Another strategy is to worry more about gunning down all the planes. This also could lead to a
high score because points are also made by hitting targets.

There are a few extra things that will make the game more challenging and hopefully more fun.
There will be serpents from the Anaconda Army that the agent must avoid hitting at all costs.
Also planets will exist and be another thing to avoid while crawling through space.
