Serpents in Space
=================

Project 2 for EECS 493

## Overview
After their previous bout against Manuel El Jackson, the serpents are seeking revenge. Manuel
went on a rampage and nearly killed off the entire snake population. Of the few surviving snakes,
two brilliant anacondas happened to be groundbreaking scientists in genetic mutation. After a
many years of research, the snakes created a new species of space serpents (Proof from NASA:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we2RQ3Ps82I). These snakes have the ability to fly through
outer space while carrying rocket launchers. Knowing that the Manuel and his fleet are heading
to Mars to pick up Martian war criminals, the snakes have planned retribution. Equipped with
weapons, the anacondas plan on taking down all of Manuelâ€™s space vehicles.

## Setup

At this point, I do not remember how to build this project. Hopefully I will figure it out.
