# Grading Criteria

### Is the game fully functional?
Yes. All the graphics render well and the gameplay is quick and simple. The user only has a
certain amount of lives and the game ends after all lives are used. The score is then displayed for
the user.

### Is the game original?
This is the continuation of the first game. Now the player of the game is on the snake’s side
trying to take down Manuel El Jackson’s fleet of planes that happen to be in space. The
gameplay is original because the user cannot control the speed of the camera. The speed
increases over time and makes the game more challenging. Rockets are launched from the snake
to take down the planes.

### Is the game really 3D?
The game is set in a solar system that is very similar to the one we live in today. However there
are asteroids that keep the player in the solar system. Using the mouse, the player is able to
navigate around space in any direction. All of the models were done in 3ds Max and are also in
three dimensions.

### Is the game well designed and fun to play?
The game play is fast. All the models are well designed with great detail. As the game goes on
the snake moves at a faster pace making it much harder to avoid planets and aircrafts. There is
also a rocket launcher that can take down the planes and gain the user points. However, the user
only has 4 lives. They need to make sure they do not run into the planet, planes or asteroids as
that would result in a loss of life.

### Is the game well documented?
I have included instructions on how to play the game in the game itself. The instructions are
under the instructions button on the home screen. The instructions are also in the zip file. I have
also included my updated design document and included this document of the grading criteria.
